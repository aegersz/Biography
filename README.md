## Neurodivergent Developer’s Pledge

> *“I build not because the world demands it—  
but because my mind insists on completing patterns  
that others haven’t yet seen.”*

I pledge to:
- Design with depth, not decoration  
- Honor divergence as strength  
- Engage collaboration without compromise  
- Balance chaos with symmetry  
- Document truthfully and share what serves  
- Preserve energy, protect clarity, and never pretend
